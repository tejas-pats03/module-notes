in order to compile .py file
	go to the folder where .py file is saved e.g. "d:\\work" and give following command

python -m First.py

after this you will get to see "__pycache__" folder inside the current working folder (d:\\work).

inside this "__pycache__" folder you will get
	"First.cpython-310.pyc" file



how to run .pyc file?


D:\work\__pycache__>python First.cpython-310.pyc
