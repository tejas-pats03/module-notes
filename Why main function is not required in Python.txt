In Python, it is not necessary to define the main function every time you write a program. This is because the Python interpreter executes from the top of the file unless a specific function is defined.

e.g.


print("first")
print("second")
print("third")
def disp():
    print("disp 1")
    print("disp 2")
    print("disp 3")
print("fourth")
print("fifth")


o/p

first
second
third
fourth
fifth
